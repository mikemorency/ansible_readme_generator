# Ansible Readme Generator

This project installs a command line tool to help generate and update README.md files for arbitrary Ansible projects. It supports roles and collections by default but can also configured to create READMEs for custom project structures.

## Usage

After installing the pip package, a command line utility should be available in your virtual environment.

To see available options and the help message, simply run:ÃŸ
``` bash
ansidocs
# or
ansidocs -h
```
